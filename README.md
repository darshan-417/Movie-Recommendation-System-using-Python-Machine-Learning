Movie Recommendation System
Overview:
This project is a Movie Recommendation System developed using Python.
The system recommends movies to users based on their preferences, leveraging various machine learning techniques.
Imported two libraries:
Difflib - sequence matching 
TfidfVectorizer - text-based analysis
COSINE SIMILARITY is the main tool I have use here as its uses to measure the similarity between two non zero vector of an inner product space &
it calculate the cosine of the anglee b/w them and gives the recommended movies list based on the user input

Features:
Content-Based Filtering: Recommends movies similar to the user's preferences based on genres, actors, directors, etc., using TfidfVectorizer for analyzing textual data.
Collaborative Filtering: Uses the preferences of other users with similar tastes to recommend movies.
Hybrid Approach: Combines both content-based and collaborative filtering for more accurate recommendations.
Sequence Matching: Uses difflib to find close matches for movie titles and other categorical data.
So this an overview of my project which i have implemented in python jupiter file
